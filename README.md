Play texas holdem with each other while in World of Warcraft

4.1.0 Fix for 4.1 requiring use of RegisterAddonMessagePrefix

4.1.0 has a changed communication version and will not talk to previous versions

I am now making use of curseforge's localization. If you are interested in helping localise for your lanaguage (or another!) please drop by the addon's localization page at curseforge... every bit helps, as soon as a localization reaches around 70% I will implement it in game. Thanks

3.1.6 Brings several changes to the command line interface, most importantly connecting to a table use /holdem dealer [dealer name]

3.1.3 Brings a totally rewritten hand logic thanks to Derrick on Thunderlord-US

Updated to work with 3.0 by Gendi.

My notes/observations:-

You can close the game window with the spade button and the game will carry on, when it's your time to do something the minimap icon will flash.

Both the game and mini map icon are draggable with left click.

This version has no compability with previous versions, the communication is totally different.
